Hello there, i am **Elite Enrise** and welcome to my portofolio. I am quite skilled in many programming languages, including:
<!--START_SECTION:abc-->

```text
- Lua(U) â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ More than 4-5 Years of experience

- Python â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–’â–’â–’â–’ More than 1-2 Years of experience

- C++ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–’â–’â–’â–’ More than 1-2 Years of experience

... and more general knowledge
```

<!--END_SECTION:abc-->

I have experience with reverse engineering assembly x86, Lua things (such as obfuscators), general exploiting (such as the documentations, functionality, etc) and much more knowledge. I can assure you, none of my codes would have flaws, or any type of possible exploits, fully because of my years of experience in multiple aspects from ROBLOX.

I am a self-taught programmer. I first started with Lua, which got my attention and i kept on learning new things using it. I wanted to try something new and moved to Python, which was also very interesting. I wanted a challenge, so i went for C++, however, it wasn't any more difficult than what i previously have learned. I continue to use Lua, Python and C++ on a daily base to maintain my skills fresh.

I love open-sourcing things, because i learned the most from it. Open-source codes are the best sources of learning new things.

I have previously worked on the following games:

I am an ex-developer/developer of the following groups:
